# SCOPE - Security Check for Open-source Package Ecosystems

**ML-powered supply chain security scanner for npm packages.**

SCOPE detects malicious, typosquatted, and suspicious npm packages before you install them, using a Random Forest classifier trained on package metadata, enriched with GitHub signals, and explained via SHAP values. It ships as a CLI tool, a web UI, and a GitHub Action that blocks risky dependencies at the PR level.

---

## The Problem

`npm audit` only catches known CVEs. It has no opinion on a brand-new package named `react-domm` published yesterday by an anonymous maintainer with a postinstall script. Supply chain attacks increasingly exploit this blind spot - SCOPE closes it.

---

## How It Works

```
Package name
     |
     v
npm Registry API ──> raw metadata (versions, maintainers, scripts, license...)
GitHub API       ──> repo signals (stars, contributors, last commit, issues...)
     |
     v
Feature Engineering (15+ signals computed from raw data)
     |
     v
Random Forest Classifier (trained on 600 labelled packages)
     |
     v
SHAP Explainer (per-prediction feature attribution)
     |
     v
Health Score + Human-readable explanation
```

The model flags packages based on signals like: days since first publish, release velocity, contributor count, presence of a `postinstall` script, download-to-star ratio, and more. Every prediction comes with a ranked explanation of *why* — not just a score.

---

## Features

- **CLI tool** — scan any package or your entire `package.json` in seconds

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A GitHub personal access token (for GitHub API enrichment)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reiabaid/npm
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GitHub token:
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### Scan a package

```bash
scope check lodash
scope check react-domm
```

### Scan your project's dependencies

```bash
scope batch package.json
scope batch package.json --fail-on-high   # exit code 1 if any package > 80% risk
```

### Output options

```bash
scope check axios --json    # machine-readable JSON output
scope --version
scope --help
```

---

## Sample Output

```
Package   : react-domm
Version   : 1.0.0  (published 1 day ago)
Risk Score: ████████████████░░░░  94%

STATUS: HIGH RISK — DO NOT INSTALL

Top Risk Factors:
  + 42%   Has postinstall script
  + 31%   Published less than 7 days ago
  + 18%   Zero GitHub contributors
  -  8%   Has repository link (partial trust)

Did you mean: react-dom?
This package name is 1 edit away from a popular library.
```

---

## GitHub Action

Add to your repo to automatically scan dependencies on every pull request that modifies `package.json`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/scope.yml

name: SCOPE

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'package.json'
      - 'package-lock.json'

jobs:
  scope-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install SCOPE
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .

      - name: Run SCOPE Scan
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: scope batch package.json --json --fail-on-high
```

When a pull request adds a package that scores above 80% risk, the Action fails and blocks the merge. Results are posted as a PR comment.

---

## Web UI

Start the API server:

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser, or serve it:

```bash
cd frontend && python -m http.server 3000
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## ML Pipeline

### Dataset

- **600 packages** total — 400 healthy (top npm packages by downloads), 200 suspicious (confirmed malicious packages from public advisories + synthetic typosquats)
- **15 features** engineered from npm and GitHub metadata
- **Class imbalance** addressed with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

### Features

| Feature | Type | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| `days_since_created` | Numerical | Brand-new packages are higher risk |
| `days_since_last_update` | Numerical | Abandoned packages are higher risk |
| `num_versions` | Numerical | Version count |
| `release_velocity` | Numerical | Versions per day — burst releases are suspicious |
| `num_maintainers` | Numerical | Single-maintainer concentration risk |
| `has_postinstall` | Binary | Most common malware execution vector |
| `has_github_repo` | Binary | Missing repo link is a red flag |
| `github_stars` | Numerical | Legitimacy signal |
| `github_contributors` | Numerical | Community health signal |
| `download_to_star_ratio` | Numerical | High downloads vs low stars = anomalous |
| `open_issues_ratio` | Numerical | Maintenance signal |
| `days_since_last_commit` | Numerical | Active development signal |
| `description_length` | Numerical | Thin descriptions correlate with malicious packages |
| `num_keywords` | Numerical | Keyword stuffing signal |
| `license_is_standard` | Binary | No/unusual license is a flag |

## Build Checklist

This project was built following an 18-day structured plan. The interactive checklist (with carry-forward overflow logic for missed tasks) is available as a React component:

→ 

---

## Limitations

- Metadata-only analysis. SCOPE does not download or execute package code.
- A sophisticated attacker who mimics the metadata patterns of healthy packages (fake stars, sleeper accounts, curated history) can reduce SCOPE's detection rate.
- The model is only as good as its training data. New attack patterns not represented in the dataset will not be reliably detected.
- Not a substitute for manual review of critical dependencies.

---

## Roadmap

- NLP layer: semantic coherence between package name, description, and exports
- Anomaly detection via Isolation Forest (zero-day pattern detection)
- Graph analysis: dependency graph centrality scoring
- AST-level static analysis for obfuscated code patterns
- CV-based logo similarity detection for visual typosquatting


---

## Disclaimer

SCOPE is a heuristic tool. A HIGH RISK score is a signal to investigate, not a definitive verdict. A LOW RISK score does not guarantee a package is safe. Always apply judgment before installing dependencies in production systems.

---

## Configuration

SCOPE stores configuration in `~/.scope/config.json`. On first run, it creates this file with defaults:

```json
{
  "github_token": "",
  "npm_timeout": 30,
  "github_timeout": 30,
  "cache_expiry_hours": 1
}
```

### Set GitHub token for faster API limits

```bash
# Via environment variable (temporary)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
scope check express

# Or store permanently in config
scope set-config --github-token ghp_your_token_here
```

### Adjust cache expiry (default: 1 hour)

```bash
scope set-config --cache-expiry 24  # cache results for 24 hours
```

---

## Caching

SCOPE automatically caches analysis results (by default, for 1 hour) in `~/.scope/cache/`.

### Skip cache for fresh data

```bash
scope check lodash --no-cache
scope batch package.json --no-cache
```

### Clear cache

```bash
scope clear-cache
```

Cache is stored as JSON:
- **Location:** `~/.scope/cache/package_name_<hash>.json`
- **Format:** `{ "timestamp": "2024-01-15T...", "result": {...} }`
- **Expiry:** Controlled by `cache_expiry_hours` in config

---

## REST API

SCOPE also ships with a **FastAPI-powered REST API** for programmatic access to all package analysis features. Perfect for integrating security scanning into CI/CD pipelines, applications, and services.

### Start the API

```bash
# Development mode (hot reload on changes)
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Production mode
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

| `GET` | `/cache/clear` | Clear all cached results |

### Example API Usage

**Single package (Python):**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/analyze",
    json={"package_name": "express"}
)
result = response.json()
print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"Score: {result['score']:.4f}")
```

**Batch analysis (cURL):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packages":["express","react","vue"]}'
```

**JavaScript/Node.js:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/analyze", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ package_name: "lodash" })
});
const result = await response.json();
console.log(`${result.package}: ${result.risk_level}`);
```

### API Features

- **Response Caching:** 30-minute TTL reduces analysis time for repeated packages
- **Rate Limiting:** 10 requests per 60 seconds per IP address
- **CORS Enabled:** Cross-origin requests allowed
- **Async Processing:** Concurrent handling of multiple requests
- **Rich Explanations:** Every score includes top 4 SHAP-based feature explanations
- **Batch Operations:** Analyze up to 20 packages in a single request

### API Response Example

```json
{
  "package": "express",
  "score": 0.0011,
  "risk_level": "HEALTHY",
  "features": {
    "days_since_created": 5582,
    "num_versions": 287,
    "stargazers_count": 68924,
    "...": "..."
  },
  "explanations": [
    {
      "feature": "num_versions",
      "shap_value": -1.6469,
      "description": null
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [],
  "suggestion": null
}
```

### Error Handling

```json
{
  "detail": "Package 'nonexistent' not found on npm"
}
```

Common error codes:
- `404 Not Found` — Package does not exist on npm
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — Invalid request (e.g., too many packages)
- `429 Too Many Requests` — Rate limit exceeded
- `503 Service Unavailable` — Model not initialized

### Performance

- **First-time analysis:** 1-3 seconds (fetches npm + GitHub data)
- **Cached analysis:** 10-50ms (served from cache)
- **Batch of 20 packages:** ~3-10 seconds first run, instant on repeat
